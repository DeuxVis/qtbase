This branch is just a proof of concept to verify that using mbedTLS as a ssl backend for Qt is possible.

Do not expect anything fancy or stable for now.

Tested against mbedTLS version 2.8.0 and QT 5.12.0, and for https usage only.

Use a configure command with options "-ssl -no-openssl -mbedtls" to include mbedTLS as the ssl backend.
Also add "-make examples" to test the download / downloadmanager examples against https urls.
